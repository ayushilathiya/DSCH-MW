# DSCH and Microwind: CMOS Logic Gate Design and Simulation

This repository contains the design and simulation of **basic CMOS logic gates** using **DSCH** and **Microwind**. The project aims to showcase the practical implementation of **digital circuits** and **VLSI** design principles.

## Project Overview

The purpose of this project is to:
- Design basic logic gates (AND, OR, NOT, NAND, NOR) using **CMOS technology**.
- Simulate the behavior of these gates using **Microwind** for layout and **DSCH** for digital simulation.
- Provide insights into **VLSI design**, **CMOS technology**, and **gate-level design**.

## Tools Used
- **DSCH**: A tool for digital circuit design and simulation.
- **Microwind**: A layout design tool used for CMOS logic gate implementation.

## Project Structure

- **/DSCH_Circuits**: Contains the digital circuits designed in **DSCH**.
- **/Microwind_Layouts**: Contains the layouts of CMOS gates designed in **Microwind**.
- **/Simulations**: Holds simulation files and results, including waveform data.
- **README.md**: This file.

## How to Run

### DSCH Simulation:
1. Download and install **DSCH** from [DSCH website](https://www.microwind.org/dsch/).
2. Open the DSCH circuit file located in `/DSCH_Circuits`.
3. Run the simulation by clicking **Simulate** in DSCH.

### Microwind Layout:
1. Download and install **Microwind** from [Microwind website](https://www.microwind.org/).
2. Open the layout files located in `/Microwind_Layouts`.
3. Use the **Microwind** tool to simulate the layout and generate the necessary outputs.
